    %CONJGRADSOLVER  Non-linear non-constrained minimization of a function with known gradient.
    %
    % defined on an `n`-dimensional Euclidean space, using the Nonlinear
    % **Conjugate Gradient** method. The implementation was done based on the
    % beautifully clear explanatory article:
    %
    % > An Introduction to the Conjugate Gradient Method Without the Agonizing Pain
    % > http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake-papers/painless-conjugate-gradient.pdf
    % > by Jonathan Richard Shewchuk.
    %
    % The method can be seen as an adaptation of a standard Conjugate Gradient
    % method (see, for example http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_gradient_method)
    % for numerically solving the systems of linear equations.
    %
    % It should be noted, that this method, although deterministic, is rather
    % a heuristic method and therefore may converge to a local minima, not
    % necessary a global one. What is even more disastrous, most of its
    % behaviour is ruled by gradient, therefore it essentially cannot
    % distinguish between local minima and maxima. Therefore, if it starts
    % sufficiently near to the local maximum, it may converge to it. Another
    % obvious restriction is that it should be possible to compute the
    % gradient of a function at any point, thus it is preferable to have
    % analytic expression for gradient and computational burden should be born
    % by the user.
    %
    % The latter responsibility is accompilished via the `getGradient` method of
    % the function being optimized). This method takes point a point in
    % `n`-dimensional space (input argument represents the array of
    % coordinates of that point) and comput its gradient (it should be
    % returned in the output as an array).
    %
    % NOTE: term criteria should meet one of the following conditions:
    %
    % * `type == 'Count+EPS' && epsilon > 0 && maxCount > 0`
    % * `type == 'Count' && maxCount > 0`

    properties (Dependent)
        % The optimized function represented by a structure with the
        % following fields:
        %
        % * __dims__ dimensinoality of the objective function.
        % * __fun__ name of M-file that evaluates the objective function.
        % * __gradfun__ name of M-file that evaluates the gradient. default ''
        % * __gradeps__ used by finite difference method, in case `gradfun`
        %       was not supplied. default 1e-3
        %
        % It should be set before the call to cv.ConjGradSolver.minimize,
        % as default value is not usable.
        ObjectiveFunction
        % Terminal criteria for solver.
        %
        % This method is not necessary to be called before the first call to
        % cv.ConjGradSolver.minimize, as the default value is sensible.
        %
        % Algorithm stops when the number of function evaluations done exceeds
        % `Termcrit.maxCount`, when the function values at the vertices of
        % simplex are within `Termcrit.epsilon` range or simplex becomes so
        % small that it can enclosed in a box with `Termcrit.epsilon` sides,
        % whatever comes first.

            % ## Options
            % * __Function__ Objective function that will be minimized,
            %       specified as a structure with the following fields
            %       (`gradfun` and `gradeps` are optional fields):
            %       * __dims__ Number of dimensions
            %       * __fun__ string, name of M-file that implements the
            %             `calc()` method. It should receive a vector of the
            %             specified dimension, and return a scalar value of
            %             the objective function evaluated at that point.
            %       * __gradfun__ string, name of M-file that implements the
            %             `getGradient()` method. It should receive an `ndims`
            %             vector, and return a vector of partial derivatives.
            %             If an empty string is specified (default), the
            %             gradient is approximated using finite difference
            %             method as: `F'(x) = (F(x+h) - F(x-h)) / 2*h` (at the
            %             cost of exta function evaluations and less accuracy).
            %       * __gradeps__ gradient step `h` used in finite difference
            %             method. default 1e-3
            % * __TermCriteria__ Terminal criteria to the algorithm. default
            %       `struct('type','Count+EPS', 'maxCount',5000, 'epsilon',1e-6)`
            %

            % only sensible ones, `ObjectiveFunction` should be set upon the
            % obtained object, if the function was not given in the constructor.
            % Otherwise, the two ways (submit it to ctor or miss it out and
            % set the `ObjectiveFunction` property) are absolutely equivalent
            % (and will drop the same errors in the same way, should invalid
            % input be detected).
