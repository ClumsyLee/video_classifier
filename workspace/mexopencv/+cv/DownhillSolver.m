    %DOWNHILLSOLVER  Non-linear non-constrained minimization of a function.
    %
    % defined on an `n`-dimensional Euclidean space, using the **Nelder-Mead**
    % method, also known as downhill simplex method. The basic idea about the
    % method can be obtained from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelder-Mead_method.
    %
    % It should be noted, that this method, although deterministic, is rather
    % a heuristic and therefore may converge to a local minima, not necessary
    % a global one. It is iterative optimization technique, which at each
    % step uses an information about the values of a function evaluated only
    % at `n+1` points, arranged as a simplex in `n`-dimensional space (hence
    % the second name of the method). At each step new point is chosen to
    % evaluate function at, obtained value is compared with previous ones and
    % based on this information simplex changes it's shape, slowly moving to
    % the local minimum. Thus this method is using only function values to
    % make decision, on contrary to, say, Nonlinear Conjugate Gradient method
    % (which is also implemented in OpenCV).
    %
    % Algorithm stops when the number of function evaluations done exceeds
    % `Termcrit.maxCount`, when the function values at the vertices of simplex
    % are within `Termcrit.epsilon` range or simplex becomes so small that it
    % can enclosed in a box with `Termcrit.epsilon` sides, whatever comes
    % first, for some defined by user positive integer `Termcrit.maxCount` and
    % positive non-integer `Termcrit.epsilon`.
    %
    % NOTE: term criteria should meet the following conditions:
    %
    % * `type == 'Count+EPS' && epsilon > 0 && maxCount > 0`
    %

    properties (Dependent)
        % The optimized function represented by a structure with the
        % following fields:
        %
        % * __dims__ dimensinoality of the objective function.
        % * __fun__ name of M-file that evaluates the objective function.
        %
        % It should be set before the call to cv.DownhillSolver.minimize,
        % as default value is not usable.
        ObjectiveFunction
        % initial step that will be used in downhill simplex algorithm.
        % Roughly said, it determines the spread (size in each dimension)
        % of an initial simplex.
        %
        % Step, together with initial point (given in cv.DownhillSolver.minimize)
        % are two `n`-dimensional vectors that are used to determine the shape
        % of initial simplex. Roughly said, initial point determines the
        % position of a simplex (it will become simplex's centroid), while
        % step determines the spread (size in each dimension) of a simplex. To
        % be more precise, if `s` and `x` are the initial step and initial
        % point respectively, the vertices of a simplex will be:
        % `v_0 := x_0 - (1/2)s` and `v_i := x_0 + s_i` for `i=1,2,...,n` where
        % `s_i` denotes projections of the initial step of `n`-th coordinate
        % (the result of projection is treated to be vector given by
        % `s_i := e_i . <e_i . s>`, where `e_i` form canonical basis).
        InitStep
        % Terminal criteria for solver.
        %
        % This method is not necessary to be called before the first call to
        % cv.DownhillSolver.minimize, as the default value is sensible.
        %
        % Algorithm stops when the number of function evaluations done exceeds
        % `Termcrit.maxCount`, when the function values at the vertices of
        % simplex are within `Termcrit.epsilon` range or simplex becomes so
        % small that it can enclosed in a box with `Termcrit.epsilon` sides,
        % whatever comes first.

    methods
        function this = DownhillSolver(varargin)

            % ## Options
            % * __Function__ Objective function that will be minimized,
            %       specified as a structure with the following fields:
            %       * __dims__ Number of dimensions
            %       * __fun__ string, name of M-file that implements the
            %             `calc()` method. It should receive a vector of the
            %             specified dimension, and return a scalar value of
            %             the objective function evaluated at that point.
            % * __InitStep__ Initial step, that will be used to construct the
            %        initial simplex. default `[1, 1, 0.0]`.
            % * __TermCriteria__ Terminal criteria to the algorithm. default
            %       `struct('type','Count+EPS', 'maxCount',5000, 'epsilon',1e-6)`
            %
            % All the parameters are optional, so this procedure can be called
            % even without parameters at all. In this case, the default values
            % will be used. As default value for terminal criteria are the
            % only sensible ones, `ObjectiveFunction` and `InitStep` should be
            % set upon the obtained object, if the respective parameters were
            % not given in the constructor. Otherwise, the two ways (give them
            % to ctor or miss them out and set the `ObjectiveFunction` and
            % `InitStep` properties) are absolutely equivalent (and will drop
            % the same errors in the same way, should invalid input be
            % detected).
